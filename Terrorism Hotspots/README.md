#   Terrorism Hotspots Analysis

Imagine you are a security or defense analyst. Analyze the data and draw conclusions on the distribution and nature of terrorist incidents recorded around the world. In your analysis, include maps that visualize the location of different incidents. 

1. How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there certain regions where this trend is different from the global averages?

2. Is the number of incidents and the number of casualties correlated? Can you spot any irregularities or outliers?

3. What are the most common methods of attacks? Does it differ in various regions or in time?

4. Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread;

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and hotspots. Here are some key insights:

1. Regional trends:
   - The Middle East has seen the sharpest increase in terrorist events since 2000.
   - South Asia also shows a significant uptick, especially after 2000.
   - Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a notable rise in recent years.

   - Armed Assault is the second most frequent, followed by Assassination.
   - Hostage taking and attacks on facilities/infrastructure are less common but still significant.

3. Correlation between events and casualties:
   - There's a strong positive correlation between the number of terrorist events and total casualties.
   - The trend line suggests that as the number of events increases, the total casualties tend to rise proportionally.

4. Geographical distribution:
   - The heat map shows concentrations of casualties in the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa.
   - There are also notable hotspots in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia.
   - Western countries generally show lower casualty rates, with some exceptions in major cities.

5. Historical trends:
   - There's a clear increase in terrorist activities globally since the 1980s.
   - A sharp escalation is visible from the early 2000s onward.

6. Overall impact:
