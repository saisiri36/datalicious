# Scenario 1:
It is going to be a huge Saturday and there will need to be many more cars on the road than last week. In order to get drivers to go online, we're assessing the following two bonus options in terms of cost:

Option 1: $50 for each driver that is online at least 8 hours, accepts 90% of requests, completes 10 trips, and has a rating of 4.7 or better during the time frame;

Option 2: $4/trip for all drivers who complete 12 trips, and have a 4.7 or better rating.

# INSIGHTS

1. Driver Performance Metrics:
0.69: This shows the proportion of drivers with a rating of 4.7 or higher.
0.34: This represents the proportion of drivers who have completed fewer than 10 trips.
0.46: This is the proportion of drivers with an acceptance rate below 90%.
   
2. Driver Groups and Ratings:
The pie chart displays the distribution of drivers across three categories:
Drivers with fewer than 10 trips.
Drivers with less than 90% acceptance rate.
Drivers with a rating of 4.7 or higher.

3. Bonus Distribution:
The bar chart shows the total bonus amounts for two different options (Option 1 and Option 2) based on the number of supply hours.
Total Bonus Option 1: 1,050
Total Bonus Option 2: 2,976

4. Eligible Drivers:
21 drivers are eligible for Bonus Option 1.
46 drivers are eligible for Bonus Option 2.
   
5. Cost Implications:
The total cost for Bonus Option 1 is 1,050.
The total cost for Bonus Option 2 is 2,976.

# Scenario 2: 
A taxi driver currently generates $200 per day in fares (before expenses), works six days a week, takes three weeks off, and has the following expenses:

Gas - $200 per week
Insurance - $400 per month
Vehicle rent (by the week) - $500
The driver doesn't pay gas and rent expenses on off weeks.

Now, let's assume that the same driver would buy a Town Car and partner with Uber. If he does, his gas expenses would go up by 5%, his insurance expense would decrease by 20%, and he would no longer be renting a vehicle. However, he would need to buy a car. The driver would still take three weeks off per year.
